* Radiophonics Workshop Web Audio API Demos

This repo contains the source code for our project to [[http://webaudio.prototyping.bbc.co.uk/][recreate the
sound of the Radiophonic Workshop using the Web Audio API]].

The full experience including user interfaces is best viewed on our
site, but this repo provides and easier way to view the source code
of each demo.
